## Software Design

This repository contains all the projects I have created for the "Software Design" class. Feel free to draw inspiration or use the code in your own projects. I am currently learning **C++** and plan to dive into **Java**, **Python**, and other programming languages in the future.

### Contents
Each folder contains a separate project I have worked on during the class. I will gradually add new projects to showcase my progress in learning.

### Technologies & Languages:
- **C++**: The main language used in the projects. I focus on object-oriented programming, algorithms, and data structures.
- **Java**: I plan to explore this language and incorporate it into future projects.
- **Python**: I plan to explore this language and incorporate it into future projects.

### Learning Goals:
- Enhance my skills in **C++** and work on more advanced algorithms.
- Dive into **Java** and apply object-oriented programming principles in real-world applications.
- Learn **Python** in the context of automation and data processing.

### Contribution & Open Source:
- Feel free to fork the repository, create issues, and submit pull requests. I am always open to feedback and eager to learn from others.
